## gfinder

This is a Gif browsing app that I created to practice Flutter. I started by following Daniel Ciolfi's tutorial, then I kept updating the app, refactoring and adding new functionality. I reorganized the original app creating different files for widgets, views, controlling and models.

## Installation and usage

You need to provide an API key for the Giphy Developers API as an environment variable. To do this, create a file named `.env` at the root folder with the following format: `API_KEY=your_api_key`

To run the app on debug mode, use the command `flutter run`. Be sure you have installed Flutter and the Android SDK. If this is your first time with flutter, below are some useful resources:
